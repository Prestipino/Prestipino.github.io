  <h3>FullProf Files and Tools</h3>

  <p>
    This section provides several input files (<code>.pcr</code>) for the 
    <strong>FullProf</strong> software suite, used for structure refinement 
    from X-ray or neutron diffraction data. Each link opens an interactive page 
    containing the original input file, enriched with explanatory comments and 
    <em>tooltips</em> that describe the meaning and role of individual PCR parameters.
  </p>

  <p>
    These examples illustrate a range of experimental and methodological configurations, 
    from classical synchrotron data to recent multipattern refinement approaches. 
    A complementary link is also provided for <strong>Faults</strong>, another program 
    within the FullProf suite, dedicated to the modeling of structural defects 
    and stacking disorder.
  </p>

  <!-- ===== Conclusion ===== -->
  <p>
    These resources are intended to support the understanding and practical use 
    of the FullProf suite in both research and teaching contexts, by providing 
    commented examples and interactive guidance.
