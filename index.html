  <h1>Welcome to My Research Hub</h1>

  <p>
    I am <strong>Carmelo Prestipino</strong>, a researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) working in the
    <em>Cristallographie et Physique de la Matière</em> team at the CRISMAT laboratory in Caen, France. My scientific work is rooted in
    solid-state chemistry and crystallography, with a strong emphasis on experimental and computational approaches to structural
    characterization. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
  </p>

  <p>
    I graduated with a PhD in Materials Science, and since then I have developed my expertise in the use of diffraction techniques — notably
    X-ray and electron diffraction — to investigate complex crystalline materials. My research spans from fundamental studies of atomic
    structure to applications where structure–property relationships are crucial. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

  <p>
    At CRISMAT, my work focuses on deciphering the atomic arrangements in materials that exhibit structural complexity, incommensurability,
    and disorder — features that often require a combination of advanced diffraction methods and modelling to unravel. These investigations
    contribute to a better understanding of how subtle structural features influence physical properties in systems such as thermoelectrics,
    mixed-anion compounds, and other functional materials. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
  </p>

  <p>
    Much of this research involves collaborations — both within CRISMAT and with national and international partners — to combine diffraction
    experiments, computational analysis, and theoretical interpretation. Representative work includes structural studies of sulfide and
    chalcogenide systems where unconventional structural motifs lead to interesting electronic or thermal behaviours relevant to energy
    applications. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

    This website is intended as a resource for the broader scientific community interested in structural analysis and computational research.
    Here you will find tools, tutorials, and references that support diffraction data interpretation, structural modelling, and reproducible
    workflows. Whether you are a student, experimentalist, or computational researcher, I hope you find the material both accessible and
    practically useful.

  <p>
    <strong>PlotTxrd</strong> is a graphical application for the visualization, analysis, and
    management of X-ray diffraction (XRD) data, with a particular focus on
    <em>temperature-dependent experiments</em> and high-throughput measurements
    typically collected at synchrotron beamlines.
  </p>
  <p>
    The software handles a wide range of data formats (<code>.xye</code>, <code>.dat</code>,
    <code>.raw</code>, <code>.uxd</code>, <code>.ras</code>, <code>.XrdML</code>),
    and provides integrated tools for data inspection, background subtraction,
    merging, and export to <strong>JANA</strong> or <strong>FullProf</strong> formats.
