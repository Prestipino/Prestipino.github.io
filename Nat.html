        –Structure factor model and refinement method for the phase</span> <br>
      <span style="color: red;">= 0</span> The phase is treated with the
      Rietveld Method, then refining a given structural model. <br>
      <span style="color: red;">= 1</span> The phase is treated with the
      Rietveld Method and it is considered as pure magnetic. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only magnetic atoms are required. In order to obtain
      the correct values of the magnetic <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moments the scale factor and structural parameters must
      be constrained to have the <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; same values (except a multiplying factor defined by the
      user) that their crystallographic <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; counterpart. See note on magnetic refinements. The
      three extra parameters <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; characterising the atomic magnetic moments corresponds
      to components (in Bohr <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; magnetons) along the crystallographic axes. <br>
      <span style="color: red;">=-1</span> As 1 but the three extra parameters
      characterising the atomic magnetic moments <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corresponds to the value of M (in Bohr magnetons) the
      spherical &#934; angle with X axis <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the spherical &#920; angle with Z axis. This mode works
      only if the Z axis is <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perpendicular to the XY plane. (for monoclinic space
      groups the Laue Class 1 1 2/m is <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; required). <br>
      <span style="color: red;">= 2</span> Profile Matching mode with constant
      scale factor. <br>
      <span style="color: red;">=-2</span> As 2 but instead of intensity the
      modulus of the structure factor is given in the <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CODFILn.hkl file <br>
      <span style="color: red;">= 3</span> Profile Matching mode with constant
      relative intensities for the current phase. The scale <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; factor can be refined. In this case Irf(n_pat) must be
      equal to 2, see below. <br>
      <span style="color: red;">=-3</span> As 3 but instead of intensity the
      modulus of the structure factor in absolute units <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (effective number of electrons for X-rays/ units of
      10-12 cm for neutrons) is given in the <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CODFILn.hkl file. This structure factor is given for
      the non-centrosymmetric part of the <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; primitive cell, so for a centrosymmetric space group
      with a centred lattice the structure factor to be read is: <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freduced =
      Fconventional /(Nlat &#8901; Icen) <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where Nlat is the multiplicity of the conventional cell
      and Icen=1 for non-<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; centrosymmetric space groups and Icen=2 for
      centrosymmetric space groups. <br>
      <span style="color: red;">= 4</span> The intensities of nuclear
      reflections are calculated from a routine handling Rigid body <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; groups. <br>
      <span style="color: red;">= 5</span> The intensities of magnetic
      reflections are calculated from a routine handling conical <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; magnetic structures in real space. <br>
      <span style="color: red;">=+10/-10</span> The phase can contain nuclear
      and magnetic contributions STFAC is called for <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reflections with no propagation vector associated and
      CALMAG is called for satellite <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reflections. CALMAG is also called for fundamental
      reflections if there is no <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; propagation vector given but the number of magnetic
      symmetry matrices (MagMat, see <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; below) is greater than 0. The negative value indicates
      spherical components for <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; magnetic parameters. For this case the atom parameters
      are input in a slightly different <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; format. <br>
      <span style="color: red;">=+15/-15</span> The phase is treated as a
      commensurate modulated crystal structure. All the input <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; propagation vectors and also k=(0,0,0) are identified
      to be magnetic and/or structural by <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the reading subroutine. All nuclear contributions at
      reflections without propagation <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vectors (fundamental reflections of the basic
      structure) and all the reflections associated <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to a modulation propagation vector (superstructure
      reflections), are calculated by <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MOD_STFAC. Magnetic contributions are added, if
      necessary, calling the subroutine <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CALMAG as in the case of Jbt=+10/-10. The negative
      value indicates spherical <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; components for magnetic parameters. This value of Jbt
      implies the use of a specific <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; format for atom parameters. </p>

      the space group <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; symbol <br>
      = 1 The list h, k , l, Mult is read from file CODFILn.hkl (where n is the
      ordinal number of <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the current phase) <br>
      =-1 The satellite reflections are generated automatically from the given
      space group symbol <br>
      = 2 The list h, k, l, Mult, Intensity (or Structure Factor if Jbt=-3) is
      read from file <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CODFILn.hkl. <br>
      = 3 The list h, k, l, Mult, Freal, Fimag is read from file CODFILn.hkl. In
      this case, the <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; structure factor read is added to that
      calculated from the supplied atoms. This is useful <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for simplifying the calculation of structure
      factors for intercalated compounds (rigid host). <br>

      symbol. <br>
      =+/-1 The symmetry operators are read below. In the case of a pure
      magnetic phase Isy must <br>
      be always equal to 1 or 2. <br>
      =2 The basis functions of the irreducible representations of the
      propagation vector group <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are read instead of symmetry operators. At
      present this works only for a pure magnetic <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; phase.&nbsp; <br>
      For Jbt=10 with magnetic contribution Isy could be 0 but a comment
      starting with <br>
      “Mag” should be given after the space group symbol.&nbsp;</p>
