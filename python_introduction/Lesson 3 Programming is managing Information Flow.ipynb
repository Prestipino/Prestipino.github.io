    "### 2) Fortran style loop: using enumerate() ###\n",
    "The enumerate function in Python is a useful utility for iterating over elements in an iterable (e.g., a list, tuple, or string) while also keeping track of the index or position of each element. It returns pairs of index and element during each iteration, making it convenient for scenarios where you need both the item and its index. Here's a brief explanation and example:\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "enumerate(iterable, start=0)\n",

    "    iterable: The iterable to be enumerated.\n",
    "    start: (Optional) The starting value of the index. Default is 0.\n",

    "In Python, loops (such as for and while loops) can be augmented with break, continue, and else clauses to control their behavior. Here's an explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **break** Statement: ####\n",
    "        The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely. When encountered, it terminates the loop immediately, and the control is transferred to the next statement following the loop.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **else** Clause: #####\n",
    "\n",
    "    The else clause in a loop is executed when the loop condition becomes False. However, if the loop was terminated by a break statement, the else clause is skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "    for i in range(5):\n",
    "        print(i)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Loop completed without a break\")\n",
    "    # Output: 0 1 2 3 4 Loop completed without a break\n",

    "        print(\"Loop completed without a break\")\n",
    "    # Output: 0 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "These constructs provide control flow mechanisms within loops. break and continue allow you to alter the normal flow of the loop based on certain conditions, and the else clause in a loop can be used for code that should be executed after the loop has completed successfully (without encountering a break statement)."

    "The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem in computer science and recursion. It involves moving a tower of disks from one peg to another, subject to the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",
    "*Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.\n",
    "*No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "1) The hanoi function is a recursive function that takes the number of disks (n) and three pegs (source, target, and auxiliary) as parameters.\n",
    "2) The base case (if n > 0) ensures that the recursion stops when there are no disks left to move.\n",
    "3) The recursive calls move n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg and then move the nth disk from the source peg to the target peg.\n",
    "4) The function is called with the initial configuration of the Tower of Hanoi: hanoi(3, 'A', 'C', 'B'). This means there are 3 disks on peg 'A', and we want to move them to peg 'C' using peg 'B' as an auxiliary peg.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The output of the program shows the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for 3 disks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation follows the recursive nature of the Tower of Hanoi problem, where the movement of a tower of disks is broken down into smaller sub-problems.\n",
